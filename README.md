## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Managing employee training, development, motivation, and day-to-day management is known as 
people management. Managers are typically in charge of personnel management in their 
departments; however, other departments may assist depending on the corporate structure.
For example, if you have a chief of staff, that individual is responsible for people management 
while department heads are responsible for the work product. There is, of course, some overlap 
between both responsibilities, and excellent people management requires that both the project 
and the people sides work correctly.   

For their management, people seek good leaders. Their leaders must provide clarity, context, 
consistency, courage, and commitment. You won't get employee buy-in or engagement unless 
you do this. You will be able to locate employees who will come to work and complete the 
assigned tasks, but your turnover will be high, and your productivity will be low.
People management is a vast issue that encompasses the development, organization, problem-solving, and growth of employees. These abilities range from mediating a personality 
disagreement amongst team members to developing a business's performance management 
strategy.  

People management differs from performance management because it considers more than just 
employees' jobs and instead focuses on their whole well-being. People management is about 
helping employees solve problems and engage effectively with other team members. In contrast, 
performance management is about the constant process of creating and evaluating employee 
progress against established goals.
Current and aspiring leaders who want to increase workplace communication and train staff for 
success must have influential people management skills. Examining the skills that go into people 
management will help you figure out your strengths and weaknesses.


## The Five C’s <a name="the-five-cs"></a>

**1. Clarity:**
Giving people instructions is an essential component of management. Employees can better 
comprehend what they need to do and how to do it when there is clarity. This is not the same as 
micromanagement, in which a manager excessively writes out each step and watches while the 
employee completes it. This entails providing clear, concise information so that the employee 
understands the boss's expectations. Knowing what they need to do offers everyone a sense of 
security.

**2. Context:**
Context is also crucial when conducting an investigation, such as part of a grievance procedure. 
Nothing happens in a vacuum, and a thorough investigation considers both the situation's context 
and the content.
An employee's timeliness, for example, maybe a problem. When an employee's absences 
exceeded the policy's limit, a supervisor with poor people management abilities would simply 
note them and terminate them. A people-oriented boss would approach the employee to find out 
what was going on. It could simply be that the employee is getting up too late in the morning, or 
it could be that the person has a severe problem that the manager can either help fix or find a 
solution for. That's why it's critical to comprehend the context of your team's performance issues. 
It's all too simple to categorize folks as slackers or unpleasant. People's jobs and personal 
circumstances frequently cause poor performance. If you can better understand the context, you 
can respond more appropriately.

**3. Consistency:**
Parent parenting literature discusses setting timetables for your children and following through 
with consequences. People management is similar but with older children. Consistency is about 
consistently reaffirming your expectations. This requires work because you must ensure that you 
are aware of the messages you are sending. Continuously providing feedback and coaching team 
members is one of the best methods to demonstrate consistency. This might be a fantastic 
technique to get back on track if they get off track. Character is crucial because team members 
will be unsure about the rules without it.

**4. Courage:**
People managers typically earn more than individual contributors for various reasons, one of 
which is courage. Sitting down with an employee and telling him he needs to change can be 
difficult. Informing someone that their behavior is unacceptable can be awkward and 
uncomfortable. Of course, there have been moments when you've needed to have a hygiene 
conversation with a coworker. While it may appear kind to overlook an employee's flaws and 
shortcomings, a manager is responsible to the organization and its other employees. It may be the 
easy way to ignore an employee who abuses and harasses other employees, but it's not good 
management. It lowers department morale and harms the organization in the long run. The 
bravery to do the right thing is critical.

**5. Commitment:**
It takes time to develop good managerial skills. It necessitates a lot of effort and patience. You 
must plan and prepare for the future and fix errors when they occur. When you start a new 
project (or your employer assigns one to you) or recruit a new employee, the completed project, 
or thoroughly trained employee does not emerge overnight. It would help if you were dedicated 
to both the process and the people. There will be no successful personnel management if this 
does not happen.


## Staff Selection Factors <a name="staff-selection-factors"></a>

- **Application domain experience:** The developers of a project must grasp the application domain 
to design a successful solution. Some domain experience is required for some members of a 
development team.
- **Platform experience:** If low-level programming is involved, this could be crucial. In most cases, 
this is not a critical attitude.
- **Programming language experience:** This is usually only relevant for short-term assignments 
where learning a new language is not feasible. While learning a language is not difficult, being 
adept at using the related libraries and components takes several months.
- **Educational background:** This may reveal what the individual understands and their aptitude to 
learn. As engineers gain experience on various projects, this component becomes less critical.
-** Communication ability:** Project team members must be able to interact with other engineers, 
managers, and customers both vocally and in writing.
- **Adaptability:** Candidates' adaptability can be assessed by looking at their prior experience. This 
is an essential characteristic since it displays a willingness to learn.
-** Attitude:** Project team members should be enthusiastic about their work and eager to learn new 
abilities. This is a refreshing attitude, yet it can be tough to evaluate.
- **Personality:** This is a crucial characteristic that is tough to evaluate. Candidates must get along 
well with the rest of the team. No personality type is more suited to software engineering than 
another

## Management Activities <a name="management-activities"></a>

The project's goals and priorities govern management actions. Management, for example, will be 
required to submit regular reports on the project's status and development. Balancing needs, 
timing, and money will also have to adhere to specific priorities.  

**Planning:**
The first task that a manager must complete is to plan. If you have a lot on your plate, it's a good idea to sit down and make a plan to prepare if things go wrong. Managers are the people who everyone turns to for guidance. As a result, an unexpected manager is a disaster for the business. One of the essential management activities is planning, which must be done with the future in mind.  

**Problem-solving:**
Once a plan is completed, it is the responsibility of the manager's subordinates to put the plan into action. On the other hand, the work will fail if the task has not been allocated. As a result, a manager who does not successfully delegate is ineffective in his management activities. Employees frequently say they were unaware of their responsibilities because the manager failed to communicate them. As a result, management is responsible for delegating those tasks and empowering people.  

**Motivating:**
Business is a fast-paced environment that may be busy and demanding. Employees may become 
demotivated in such situations. It is the manager's responsibility to assess this and, as a result, spend time inspiring the personnel. A manager has various motivational tools, including the 3 R's - remuneration, recognition, and respect. Management may keep their staff motivated through these ways and different additional tactics, which is one of the most critical management tasks, especially in larger firms.  

**Estimating:**
It is about estimating how fast people will work. The manager needs to assess who is good at 
what aspect and assign responsibilities based on their pace of work. The main objective is to 
complete the project before the deadline, so the manager's responsibility is to make sure the 
project is done before the deadline.  

**Controlling:**
Controlling refers to measuring, comparing, identifying deviations, and modifying organizational actions to meet goals or objectives. As a result, regulating entails tasks such as assessing performance, comparing it to an established standard, identifying variances, and rectifying deviations. Control activities are usually concerned with determining whether or not a goal has been achieved or the outcomes of actions performed to accomplish the goal.  

**Organizing:**
Organizing is a qualitative rather than quantitative activity. The most effective organizer is one who can multi-task. As an example, consider an event planner or an orchestra manager. Both of these individuals are juggling many tasks at the same time. And everything is run in a well-organized manner. As a result, after planning and delegating, an organization becomes one of the most important management tasks for any firm's management  


## Organizational Structures <a name="organizational-structures"></a>

**Hierarchical Organization structure:**
A hierarchical organizational structure contains a direct chain of command from top to bottom. 
This type of structure is prevalent mainly in big organizations.  

**Advantages**  

Everyone knows who their supervisor is from top to bottom in a hierarchical company. If you 
have an issue or a complaint, you know who to contact. You only go around your direct boss if 
they are the issue. Because of this top-to-bottom authority structure, senior executives may 
confidently hand down directions, knowing that each layer will watch the performance of those
below them. Employees in a hierarchical organization are aware of the company's promotion 
path, may observe what their boss does daily, and can plan for advancement.  

**Disadvantages:**  

Because you are the decision-maker at the top, you will have more control over your 
organization if you utilize this approach. No one, however, can override your judgment if you 
make a mistake. Because of the necessity to follow the chain of command, it takes longer for top 
personnel to speak with lower-level employees and vice versa. In many circumstances, different 
tiers of personnel seldom communicate, if at all.  

**Matrix Organization structure:**  

A matrix organization is a working system in which team members report to several different 
leaders. This provides a viable alternative to the standard top-down management structure.
There are two or more management reporting structures in matrix organizations. While this may 
appear perplexing, each department typically has a primary manager.
Working under the direction of a department manager is similar to a typical work arrangement. 
IT team members, for example, report to the IT department head. The vice president of their 
division reports to the head of the IT department. All reporting ties eventually go to the CEO.
A matrix organization differs in that team members report to project managers. Members of 
several departments, such as IT, marketing, and finance, are frequently called upon to work on 
projects.  


**Advantages:**  

• Improves collaboration and flexibility.  

• Encourages open communication.  

• Helps companies (and teams) stay nimble.  

**Disadvantages:**  

• Lack of clarity around roles and responsibilities.  

• Potential for conflict between functional and project managers.  

• Slower decision-making process.  



## TKI Model <a name="tki-model"></a>

A person's conflict-related behavior is assessed using the Thomas-Kilmann Instrument. "Conflict 
situations" occur when the interests of two people appear to be at odds. These two fundamental 
features of human conduct (aggression and cooperation) can then be used to create five conflict 
resolution options.  

**Competing:** It is abrasive and uncooperative behavior in which one person pursues their own 
goals at the expense of the other. This is a power-oriented style in which you use whatever power 
you have—argumentative ability, rank, or economic penalties—to win your own viewpoint. 
"Fighting for your rights," "defending a position you believe is correct," or simply "trying to 
win" are all examples of competing.
In the sense that it is passive and cooperative, Accommodating is the polar opposite of 
competing. When a person is accommodating, he puts aside his concerns to meet the needs of 
others; this approach requires some self-sacrifice. Accommodating is defined as selfless kindness 
or charity, obeying another person's instruction when you don't want to, or yielding to another's 
point of view.
The individual who avoids is impregnable and uncooperative; they do not pursue their own or 
the other's concerns. As a result, he avoids confronting the issue. Avoidance can be as simple as 
politely preventing a problem, deferring until a more convenient time, or withdrawing from a 
potentially harmful circumstance.  

**Collaborating:** Collaborating is forceful and cooperative, which is the polar opposite of 
avoiding. Collaborating entails attempting to work with others to come up with a solution that 
fully addresses all of their concerns. It involves delving into a problem to determine the two 
people's underlying needs and desires. Exploring a disagreement to learn from each other's 
perspectives or trying to develop a creative solution to an interpersonal problem are examples of 
collaboration between two people.  


**Compromise:** It is mild in both assertiveness and cooperativeness. The goal is to find a rapid, 
mutually acceptable solution that somewhat satisfies both parties. It's a happy medium between 
competing and accommodating. Compromising necessitates more sacrifice than competing, but 
not as much as housing. Similarly, instead of ignoring an issue, it confronts it head-on, but it 
does not go into as much detail as collaboration. In certain circumstances, compromise entails 
bridging the gap between opposing ideas, making concessions, or pursuing a quick middleground solution.
All five conflict-resolution modes are available to each of us. When it comes to dealing with 
disagreements among us, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. On the other hand, some people 
are better at employing specific modes than others and, as a result, rely on them more heavily 
than others—whether owing to temperament or practice.
As a result, your conflict behavior at work is influenced by both your own predispositions and 
the circumstances in which you find yourself. The Thomas-Kilmann Instrument is a conflictresolution model evaluation tool that may be applied to a variety of group and organizational 
settings.

## SWAT <a name="swat"></a>

A 'SWAT Team' is an organizational structure model in software engineering. A SWAT project 
aims to get as much done as possible in a short amount of time, usually on a small, difficult task. It's common in iterative and evolutionary software development methodologies such as IBM 
Rational Unified Process and Agile Software Development. This pattern applies to any company 
with many teams and/or projects and where the symptoms are obvious, but the root cause is 
difficult to discover or treat.    


When the SWAT team is nominated, it must be staffed by the best software specialists in the 
organization (Architects, testers, designers, and coders). This means that other initiatives and those who assisted those projects in moving forward more swiftly will lose some human 
resources. As a result, it's vital to be flexible when naming this team first and think about each task in partnership with the software development and project management teams.    


The nomination of this team is likely to result in it remaining together for a long time, reducing the number of people available for other software development teams or projects indefinitely. 
This is not a desirable circumstance. The SWAT team should be a one-time thing, put together 
just to help the previously halted project get back on track. When that project's priority rises, or it is no longer hungry, we should consider terminating the SWAT team's efforts and returning them to their original teams.  

Another issue to consider is the loss of specialized knowledge by the SWAT team. This is 
particularly problematic if some of the employees are part of highly technical teams dealing with 
fast-changing understanding. As a result, the SWAT squad should be assembled only when 
absolutely necessary. When recruiting individuals for the SWAT team, consider why they want 
to be on a generalist squad in the first place. Some people will be ecstatic to do so, while others 
will be less so.

## Agile Team <a name="agile-team"></a>

A **"team" ** in the Agile idea is a small group of people who are all working full-time on the same 
project or effort. A small number of team members may work part-time or have other 
commitments. To develop the final product or service, every member of an Agile team is 
required. The team is frequently cross-functional, with roles altering depending on the project's 
needs and the Agile technique employed.  

**Principles:**  

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and successful delivery of the 
software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness 
change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with 
a preference for a shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they 
need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a 
development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users 
should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and 
adjusts its behavior accordingly.


## Communication Skills <a name="communication-skills"></a>

Whether you're looking for a job or buying meals at a restaurant, practical communication skills are vital in our daily lives. However, in work, when groups of people with different abilities and tasks must come together and collaborate to achieve company goals, these skills become much more critical. Practical communication skills are essential in our daily lives, whether we're looking for work or ordering food at a restaurant. These skills become considerably more crucial at work when groups of people with varied abilities and tasks must come together and collaborate to achieve business goals.
  
  **The top 4 communication skills  **  
  

- **Listening**  

The first — and possibly most important — communication skill it's not about what you're 
saying. It's ensuring that you hear and comprehend what the other person is saying. This is when 
active listening comes into play. It requires making inquiries to avoid misunderstandings. It 
includes exhibiting that you are paying attention to what is being spoken. If the person you're 
communicating with doesn't notice you're paying attention, you're fighting a losing battle.  

- **Clarity**  

Concentrating on the other person's message is one thing, but you also need your own message to 
be heard loud and clear. One of the best ways to do this is to make sure you speak clearly. This 
includes things like pronouncing your words slowly and carefully. It also requires checking 
throughout your speech to ensure that everyone is paying attention and understanding what 
you're saying.  

- **Empathy**  

Empathy is the ability to understand another person's point of view and put oneself in their shoes. 
It causes you to consider what someone says in addition to why they say it. Empathy has the 
power to transform the way you connect drastically. You might notice a subtle call for help that 
you might otherwise overlook, and you can collaborate to get the product released.  

- **Building Process**  

If you want to improve your project communication abilities, you'll need to do more than just 
listen and keep an open mind. You must work hard to build and codify best practices and 
approaches to help everyone communicate more successfully. One example is drawing a clear 
line between what must be said in a meeting and what must be expressed in an email. You can 
create a separate communication channel for your team to receive project updates, such as a 
monthly report. While attempting to improve communication on a large scale, you'll need tactics 
to back up your efforts.


## Conflict Resolving Strategies <a name="conflict-resolving-strategies"></a>

**Conflict:**  
A conflict is a disagreement or argument between people or two parties. It is pretty 
natural for to occur in a row, and it is imperative to address the competition as it hurts the team's productivity. Following strategies will help in effectively handling conflicts in a productive, healthy way at the workplace.  

**Don't Ignore the Conflict:**   
If you don't like dealing with conflict, it can be tempting to bury 
your head in the sand and hope that it will go away. While this can happen on occasion, the truth is that it will make things worse most of the time. Ignored arguments tend to decay over time and resurface at inconvenient times, so do your team a favor and address conflicts as soon as they arise, nipping a potentially toxic situation in the bud.  

**Clarify the Issue:**  
If you're dealing with a problem between two team members, you must get all the facts. Gather everyone involved and determine the exact nature of the problem. As certain that all parties are aware that you are working as an unbiased mediator and that they can feel free to disclose sensitive information with you.  

**Bring involved parties together to talk:**  
After you've had a chance to speak with them individually, bring them all together in a meeting so they may work out their differences in a neutral setting. This is a time for brainstorming, active listening, and being open to diverse points of view; the goal is to reach a common understanding of the problem, everyone's role in the disagreement, and some potential solutions.   

**Identify a solution:** Now that all parties have had an opportunity to talk about the situation, it's time to figure out a satisfactory answer and how to get there. By this step, both sides should understand the other's point of view, and the problem can typically be resolved simply via facilitated open dialogue. If the matter requires further settlement, you must intervene and assist 
them in negotiating a reasonable solution. This phase might take some time and effort because 
both partners need to put their differences and preferences aside and strive toward a common 
goal (which may involve not getting everything they want out of the situation). After that, 
collaborate with both persons to develop a concrete plan.  

**Continue to monitor and follow up on the conflict:**  
Just because a problem has been 
discovered and addressed does not mean that it will go away on its own. As a manager, you 
should check in with both parties to confirm that the disagreement has been resolved and that the measures to seek a resolution have been followed. If everything appears to be going well, 
remember to take a break and watch from time to time to see if things are going well or if any 
lingering tensions need to be addressed. If it's evident that the solution didn't work or wasn't the best option for the circumstance, be proactive in engaging with both parties to reset expectations, find alternate solutions, and keep working on the problem.

## Principles for Organizing a Team <a name="principles-for-organizing-a-team"></a>

• Employ a smaller number of employees who are of higher quality. A small group of 
people achieves the highest levels of productivity. Novelists, soccer players, and 
bricklayers all fall within this category. There's no reason to suppose it doesn't apply 
equally to programmers and others in the software industry. Large groups also necessitate 
more communication, reducing efficiency and leading to more errors.  

• It is wise to select people such that a well-balanced and harmonious team results. It 
is not sufficient only to have a few top experts. A soccer team needs regular players as 
well as stars. Selecting the proper mix of people is a complicated task.  

• Someone who does not fit the team should be removed. If it turns out that a team does 
not function as a coherent unit, we are often inclined to wait a little while, see how things 
develop and hope for better times to come. In the long run, this is detrimental.  

• In the long run, an organization is better off if it helps people get the most out of 
themselves. So, you should not pursue either of the following:  

– The reverse Peter Principle: states that people ascend through the ranks of an organization until 
they become indispensable. A programmer, for example, may become the only specialist in a 
particular system. If he does not have the opportunity to work on something else, he will likely 
leave your company due to a lack of a more engaging and challenging activity. You're in serious 
trouble at that moment.  

– The Paul Principle states that people ascend through the ranks of a company until their 
expertise becomes obsolete after five years. Given the rapidity with which new advances in 
software engineering and computer science, in general, enter the market, employees must have 
the chance to learn and improve.  

**Try to fit tasks to the capabilities and motivation of the people available In other words:** take 
care that the Peter Principle does not apply in your situation. In many organizations, excellent 
programmers can be promoted only into managerial positions. It is also far better to offer career 
possibilities in more technical software development and maintenance areas.


## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

People management is a crucial role that all leaders and managers in a company should conduct 
with care. To establish the ideal working environment, they must follow people's practices. They 
must use modern-day solutions like Talenx to develop a people management system that assures 
they acquire, manage, and retain the best-fit personnel in the organization in this data-driven era.   


HRM is a resource-oriented approach to people management that focuses primarily on 
management in terms of assigning HRM responsibilities to line management and management 
development. When it comes to strategy and strategic notions, HRM is strategic in the sense that 
it is always focused on supporting a company in gaining a long-term competitive advantage. 
HRM is largely concerned with anticipating organizational needs, the continuous monitoring and 
adjustment of personnel systems to suit current and future requirements, as well as the 
management of change, as opposed to the previous. When it comes to people management, a 
manager must concentrate on both hiring the appropriate people and then getting the best out of 
them.   

New hires must supply the organization with the best talent available to suit the company's 
requirements. The company must consider how a new employee may be put to the best possible 
use. To get the most out of an employee, a company must have consistent policies and practices 
in place to give adequate training and development to its employees. Employees are considered 
"partners" in the company. Within the topic of people management, people empowerment can be 
a very powerful instrument. This method can be used to get employees involved in any 
improvement effort within a company. Employees are given authority, accountability, and 
responsibility for improving systems under their control without needing to seek permission from 
management first. Only when staff is recognized, congratulated, and rewarded for their 
commitment to problem-solving will this be successful.
